				<p>By using this website you are agreeing to be bound by these Terms and Conditions for the use of hikermeals.com.  If you do not agree to any of these terms, then you can't use the site.</p>

				<h4>1. License for use</h4>
				<p>Permission is granted to temporarily view or download one copy of the materials (information or software) on Hiker Meals' web site for personal, non-commercial transitory viewing only. This is the grant of a license, not a transfer of title, and under this license you may not:</p> 
				<ol>
					<li>modify or copy the materials;</li>
					<li>use the materials for any commercial purpose, or for any public display (commercial or non-commercial);</li>
					<li>remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the materials; or</li>
					<li>transfer the materials to another person or "mirror" the materials on any other server.</li>
				</ol>

				<p>This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these restrictions and may be terminated by Hiker Meals at any time.

				<h4>2. Referral Rules</h4>

				<p>Our referral rewards program is intended to reward our customers who make active and genuine referrals to our website.  We will not reward cheaters, and in our definition of cheating we include the use of bots, multiple email addresses from the same user, and any other way of artificially increasing a user's referral count without actually doing any referring.</p>

				<p>To the extent that anyone actually generates 500 referrals then I totally will buy them dinner wherever they want to go, but I reserve the right to schedule when that dinner occurs, and it has to happen at a reasonably accessible location.  I determine what's reasonable, but for 500 referrals I think I can be pretty generous.</p>
